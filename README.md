# Deployment Test

This repository stores my sketch-code from when I tested out Kubernetes. The code in /photo-app-api comes from an assignment I completed in university. It's labelled "photo-app-api" but still has references to "businesses" because I had ideas of changing its purpose and then didn't implement them.

The result of this test was a working deployment of two pods, a photo-app-api pod and a mongodb pod which interfaced with each other.
